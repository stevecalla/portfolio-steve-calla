## Description

```
The app will create a professional README for a project. A user answers each question. If a question is not answered a header for that section will appear in the README. After completion of all prompts, the README will be available in the current directory and should be edited to include the final content. 
```

## Installation

(1) Fork the repo, (2) Clone the forked repo locally, (3) Run "npm install" (to install dependencies), (4) Run "node index.js" (from the /assets/js directory).

## Usage

This app creates a readme file based on user input.

## Features

This app includes features such as validation for required information and email, default answers for image, video and contribution, license badge append, instructions at the start and end of the program, modified question prefix and suffix, modular breakdown of the code (into section such as questions, answers, write to file et al), use of inquirer filter to trim and additional sections in the readme template to allow the user to customize the readme.
